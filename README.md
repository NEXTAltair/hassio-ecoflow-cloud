# EcoFlow Cloud Integration for Home Assistant
Inspired by [hassio-ecoflow](https://github.com/vwt12eh8/hassio-ecoflow) and [ecoflow-mqtt-prometheus-exporter](https://github.com/berezhinskiy/ecoflow-mqtt-prometheus-exporter) this integration uses EcoFlow MQTT Broker `mqtt.ecoflow.com` to monitor and control the device.

## Installation

- Install as a custom repository via HACS
- Manually download and extract to the custom_components directory

Once installed, use Add Integration -> Ecoflow Cloud.

## Disclaimers

⚠️ Originally developed for personal use without a goal to cover all available device attributes
