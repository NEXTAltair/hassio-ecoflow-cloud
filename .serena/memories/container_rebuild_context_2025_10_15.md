# Container Rebuild Context - 2025-10-15

## Session Summary

This session successfully resolved the Delta Pro 3 BMSHeartBeatReport decoding issue that caused 3 entities to be unavailable.

## Problem Solved

**3 Unavailable Entities:**
- Cycles (field 14 in BMSHeartBeatReport)
- Total Charge Energy (accu_chg_energy, field 79)
- Total Discharge Energy (accu_dsg_energy, field 80)

## Root Cause

File: `custom_components/ecoflow_cloud/devices/internal/delta_pro_3.py`

**Lines 577-581 had an INCORRECT mapping** that was evaluated BEFORE the correct BMSHeartBeatReport handler:

```python
# WRONG - This caught cmdFunc=32, cmdId=50 before the correct handler
elif cmd_func == 32 and cmd_id == 50:
    # RuntimePropertyUpload
    msg = pb2.RuntimePropertyUpload()
    msg.ParseFromString(pdata)
    return self._protobuf_to_dict(msg)
```

This condition was evaluated before line 636 where BMSHeartBeatReport should have been decoded, causing the wrong protobuf message type to be used.

## Solution Applied (Committed)

**Commit:** `6d270ca` - "fix(delta-pro-3): Fix BMSHeartBeatReport decoding for cycles and energy metrics"

### Changes Made:

1. **Removed lines 577-581** - Deleted the incorrect cmdFunc=32, cmdId=50 mapping
2. **Updated line 636** - Added cmdId=50 to BMSHeartBeatReport condition:
   ```python
   elif (cmd_func == 3 and cmd_id in [1, 2, 30, 50]) or \
        (cmd_func == 254 and cmd_id in [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]) or \
        (cmd_func == 32 and cmd_id in [1, 3, 50, 51, 52]):  # ← 50 added here
   ```

3. **Restored BaseDevice** - Removed `_is_binary_data()` method to maintain upstream compatibility
4. **Enhanced Makefile** - Added development commands: run, restart, stop, logs, status
5. **Added debug logging** - Better troubleshooting output

## Verification (Before Rebuild)

Logs confirmed successful decoding:
```
✅ Successfully decoded BMSHeartBeatReport: cmdFunc=32, cmdId=50
MessageToDict result: 78 fields: {
  'cycles': 201,
  'accu_chg_energy': 817932,  // 817.9 kWh total charged
  'accu_dsg_energy': 597200,  // 597.2 kWh total discharged
  ...
}
```

Main battery (num=0, bms_sn='MR51PA08PG6C0099'):
- cycles: 201
- accu_chg_energy: 817932 Wh (817.9 kWh)
- accu_dsg_energy: 597200 Wh (597.2 kWh)

Extra battery (num=2, bms_sn='E3JBZ5SG4240047'):
- cycles: 225
- accu_chg_energy: 0
- accu_dsg_energy: 0

## After Container Rebuild - Verification Checklist

### 1. Setup EcoFlow Integration
- Open Home Assistant UI: http://localhost:8123
- Go to Settings → Devices & Services
- Add EcoFlow Cloud integration via UI (Config Flow)
- Enter credentials

### 2. Verify Entity Status
Check these 3 entities are now showing values:
- **Cycles** - Should show ~201 for main battery
- **Total Charge Energy** - Should show ~818 kWh (817932 Wh)
- **Total Discharge Energy** - Should show ~597 kWh (597200 Wh)

### 3. Check Logs
```bash
make logs
# or
tail -f /config/home-assistant.log
```

Look for:
```
✅ Successfully decoded BMSHeartBeatReport: cmdFunc=32, cmdId=50
MessageToDict result: 78 fields: {'cycles': 201, 'accu_chg_energy': 817932, 'accu_dsg_energy': 597200, ...}
```

### 4. Verify MQTT Messages
BMSHeartBeatReport messages should arrive every 10 seconds:
- cmdFunc=32, cmdId=50 → BMSHeartBeatReport (78 fields)
- cmdFunc=32, cmdId=2 → CMSHeartBeatReport
- cmdFunc=254, cmdId=21 → DisplayPropertyUpload (every 2 seconds)
- cmdFunc=254, cmdId=22 → RuntimePropertyUpload (every 60 seconds)

### 5. Check WebSocket Connection
- Home Assistant UI should load without "Unable to connect" errors
- All entities should be responsive
- No `default_config` errors (fresh config)

## Reference Documentation

- **ioBroker Implementation:** https://github.com/foxthefox/ioBroker.ecoflow-mqtt/blob/main/lib/dict_data/ef_deltapro3_data.js#L4958
  ```javascript
  const msgNameObj = {
      CMSHeartBeatReport: { cmdId: 2, cmdFunc: 32 },
      BMSHeartBeatReport: { cmdId: 50, cmdFunc: 32 },  // ← Authoritative mapping
  };
  ```

## Container Rebuild Instructions

### Method 1: VSCode Command Palette (Recommended)
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
2. Type: "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container"
3. Select the command
4. Wait for rebuild to complete (~3-5 minutes)

### Method 2: VSCode UI
1. Click the green "><" icon in bottom-left corner
2. Select "Rebuild Container"

### Method 3: Manual
```bash
# Exit container and rebuild
exit
# In VS Code, reopen in container (will rebuild automatically)
```

## Development Commands (After Rebuild)

```bash
# Start Home Assistant
make run

# Restart Home Assistant
make restart

# Stop Home Assistant
make stop

# View logs
make logs

# Check status
make status

# Generate documentation
make docs

# Clean Python cache
make clean
```

## Known Issues Before Rebuild

- **WebSocket connection issue** - "Unable to connect to Home Assistant"
  - Cause: `default_config` setup failed due to go2rtc dependency
  - Solution: Fresh `/config` after rebuild will resolve this

## Expected Outcome After Rebuild

✅ All 44 entities should be available (was 41/44 before fix)
✅ BMSHeartBeatReport decodes correctly every 10 seconds
✅ Cycles, Total Charge/Discharge Energy display real values
✅ WebSocket connection stable
✅ No configuration.yaml errors

## Files Changed (Committed in 6d270ca)

1. `custom_components/ecoflow_cloud/devices/__init__.py` - BaseDevice restoration
2. `custom_components/ecoflow_cloud/devices/internal/delta_pro_3.py` - BMSHeartBeatReport fix
3. `Makefile` - Development commands

## Additional Context

- **Branch:** dev (development branch with AI tools and scripts)
- **Previous commits:**
  - 12532f1 - Claude Code hook for protobuf import fix
  - c61fe61 - BMSHeartBeatReport support (superseded by this fix)
  - 3489d87 - Protobuf import paths correction

## Session Notes

- Session ran out of context, continued from previous session
- Initial investigation showed UTF-8 decode errors after previous commit
- User directed to use ioBroker as authoritative source
- Found the incorrect mapping was the root cause (not missing cmdId=50)
- WebSocket connection issue was unrelated to our changes (default_config)
